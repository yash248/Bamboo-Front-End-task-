"# Bamboo-Front-End-task-" 
Created a page that will have the following:
1.	An input field that will take a number
2.	A counter that will count up incrementally from 0 to the given number
3.	Have 2 blocks one with the word fingers and the other with the word toes
4.	A reset button
5.	A restart button

What will the page do:
•	The counter should count up incrementally every second and the counter should stop once it reaches the given number
•	Highlight fingers when the counter is divisible by 3
•	Highlight toes when the counter is divisible by 5
•	Highlight fingers and toes when the counter is divisible by both 3 and 5
•	The reset button should reset the counter and clear the input
•	The restart button should restart the counter
